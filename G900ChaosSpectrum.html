                        <strong>Design</strong>
                        
                        For a long time, it appeared that Logitech was reluctant to follow the gaming peripheral industry's trend of big and bold design. That’s in the past: the Logitech G900 will dominate a desk with its big, pointy, glowy looks. If you’re looking for a device with desk appeal, you won’t be disappointed.

When I first held the Logitech G900, my immediate thought was that it was empty. It’s super-light, weighing only 107g, which is incredible for a wireless mouse. The Razer Mamba – not particularly heavy, by any means – weighs around a fifth more. Logitech's weight-saving strategy is so exteme, even the scroll wheel has been hollowed out and its innards replaced with a "spoked" design to help trim the fat.

The Logitech G900's body is curved, with hard edges. It’s ambidextrous, so you can use it whether you're left- or right-handed. And this isn't achieved at the expense of comfort; it feels fine in either hand, and works with both palm and claw grip.

                        <strong>features</strong>
                        With all good gaming mice come a healthy roster of features to boot, and the Logitech G900 is no different. First stop: lighting.

The Logitech G900 is branded 'Spectrum', which is marketing speak for glowing LED strips. If that concept seems familiar, it’s because it’s basically identical to Razer’s 'Chroma' in every way but name. Apparently gamers now expect their mice to glow, and in increasingly elaborate ways, so we can’t blame Logitech for mirroring the concept.

There are 16.8 million colours at your disposal, any one of which can be selected for the G900’s lighting through Logitech’s software. There are also lighting patterns available – Breathing, for example, makes the light fade in and out in a soothing fashion.
                        <strong>Performance</strong>
                        Performance is where the Logitech G900 really shines. I was hugely impressed by the accuracy of its tracking. I didn’t experience a single cursor jump, despite using the mouse on several surfaces – wood, plastic, and a SteelSeries mousepad.

For a wireless mouse, this is no mean feat. Logitech has made a big song and dance about the G900's ability to counteract the fear that wireless mice are prone to lag caused by interference, and while it's very difficult to test in real-world conditions, it looks like it's worked a treat.

This success is partly thanks to the G900’s ability to dynamically switch to less noisy frequency channels, ensuring that the mouse is always operating under the most ideal RF conditions at any given time.

But that’s not all. The Logitech G900 can track at 40G acceleration, and up to speeds of 300 inches per second. That’s faster than your hands will ever move, so rest assured that the G900 will cope admirably with twitch gameplay
                        
                        <strong>Gaming</strong>
                        I tried the Logitech G900 on a number of games, including World of Warcraft, League of Legends, Left 4 Dead 2, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

For L4D2 and CSGO, the Logitech G900 performed excellently. The low latency and accurate tracking made tearing off the heads of zombies and terrorists alike a breeze. It’s certainly the best mouse I’ve ever used for first-person-shooter gaming, so if you’re a hardcore FPS gamer, the G900 is a fantastic buy.

The G900 proved a great all-rounder, too, working just fine in League of Legends (MOBA) and World of Warcraft (MMORPG). The fact that the G900 isn’t bogged down by hardware faff makes it easy to play any game without much setting up. What’s more, the light build and comfortable design meant that I was able to play League of Legends for hours on end with very little fatigue. And I click a lot

                        <strong>Conclusion</strong>
                        The Logitech G900 is the best gaming mouse I’ve ever used, and while 200$ is a massive premium to pay, if you're after the best in class for gaming mice, you can't go wrong.
